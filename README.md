## Architecture
The app is built using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, which ensures separation of concerns and scalability. This architecture makes it easy to maintain and test the app, while allowing for a responsive user interface.

### Key Components:
- **Model**: Handles the business logic and data layer (products, categories, checkout, etc.).
- **View**: The UI elements that users interact with, such as Login, Dashboard, CategoryList, etc.
- **ViewModel**: Connects the View and Model, handling data transformation and user interactions.

---

## State Management
We use **Provider** for managing the app's state, allowing real-time updates and efficient communication between different components of the app.

### Benefits of Using Provider:
- **Reactive**: Automatically updates UI when data changes.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead in managing state.
- **Scalable**: Easy to maintain as the app grows in complexity.
